# FSDiscordBot

A small-ish discord bot implemented in F#, using the DSharpPlus library.
Created to help myself learn F# and implement custom bot features for a discord server with some friends.

## Setup Information

DSharpPlus documentation can be found [here](https://dsharpplus.github.io/index.html)


This project requires LavaLink for audio streaming, more info [here](https://dsharpplus.github.io/articles/audio/lavalink/setup.html)


I found [this](https://brandewinder.com/2021/10/30/fsharp-discord-bot/) blog post very helpful when first learning how to translate from C# into F#
